# lektor-rstfile
Adds reStructuredText support to Lektor. https://www.getlektor.com/

This is a fork of Florian Schulze's [lektor-rst](https://github.com/fschulze/lektor-rst) plugin,
that adds support for having the reStructuredText contents stored in a separate attachment 
(as opposed to inside the body field the model file).
